“Where do I start so I can become a data scientist?” This is my imperfect answer. It’s imperfect for a few reasons:

It’s missing R, Java, C, C++, C#, and Scala for machine learning. Each is a viable learning path to replace this Python centric outline.
The math is very light. I’m assuming you’ve already come in with a strong engineering or educational background.
I’ve completely overstepped cloud architectures like AWS, Google Cloud, & Azure. That’s a learning path of its own.
Computer science patterns, architecture, and best practices are largely ignored. They are critical to you becoming employable and another learning path of its own.
Finally, you also need to understand the business strategy and use cases behind data science. I’m building a series now to cover this topic.
After going through all this material, you’ll be ready to learn more…a lot more. This a jumping off point. The end of this document is the beginning of your journey into data science. You’ll understand the field well enough to start independent and guided learning about the areas your find promising or interesting.

You’ll be tempted to start building and I very much encourage you to do just that. Start building. Keep learning. Never stop doing either of those.
