### 1. Where does Git store information?

Each of your Git projects has two parts: 

+ The files and directories that you create and edit directly, and 

+ The extra information that Git records about the project's history. 

The combination of these two things is called a **repository**.

For example:

Ans: /home/repl/dental/.git


### How can I check the state of a repository?

When you are using Git, you will frequently want to check the status of your repository. To do this, run the command 
```
git status
```
, which displays a list of the files that have been modified since the last time changes were saved.

### How can I tell what I have changed?

Git has a **staging area** in which it stores files with changes you want to save that haven't been saved yet. 

Putting files in the staging area is like putting things in a box, while committing those changes is like putting that box in the mail: you can add more things to the box or take things out as often as you want, but once you put it in the mail, you can't make further changes.

```
git status
```

shows you which files are in this staging area, and which files have changes that haven't yet been put there. 
```
git diff filename
```
In order to compare the file as it currently is to what you last saved, you can use git diff filename. 

```
git diff
```
git diff without any filenames will show you all the changes in your repository, while 
```
git diff directory
```
git diff directory will show you the changes to the files in some directory.


### What's the first step in saving changes?

You commit changes to a Git repository in two steps:

1) Add one or more files to the staging area.
2) Commit everything in the staging area.
```
git add filename
```
To add a file to the staging area, use git add filename.
