### How does Git store information?

Git uses a multi-level structure to store data. 

In simplified form, this has three key parts:

1) Every unique version of every file. (Git calls these **blobs** because they can contain data of any kind.)
2) **tree** that tracks the names and locations of a set of files.
3) A **commit** that records the author, log message, and other properties of a particular commit.

As the diagram shows, each blob is stored only once, and blobs are (frequently) shared between trees. While it may seem redundant to have both trees and commits, a later part of this lesson will show why the two have to be distinct.


### What is a hash?

Every commit to a repository has a unique identifier called a **hash**

 This hash is normally written as a 40-character hexadecimal string like 7c35a3ce607a14953f070f0f83b5d74c2296ef93, but most of the time, you only have to give Git the first 6 or 8 characters in order to identify the commit you mean.
 
 Hashes are what enable Git to share data efficiently between repositories. 
 
 If two files are the same, their hashes are guaranteed to be the same.
 
  Similarly, if two commits contain the same files and have the same ancestors, their hashes will be the same as well.

### What is Git's equivalent of a relative path?

A hash is like an absolute path: it identifies a specific commit. 

Another way to identify a commit is to use the equivalent of a relative path. 

The special label ```HEAD``` which we saw in the previous chapter, always refers to the most recent commit.

```HEAD~1``` then refers to the commit before it

```HEAD~2``` refers to the commit before that, and so on

### How do I tell Git to ignore certain files?

Data analysis often produces temporary or intermediate files that you don't want to save.

You can tell it to stop paying attention to files you don't care about by creating a file in the root directory of your repository called ```.gitignore``` and storing a list of wildcard patterns that specify the files you don't want Git to pay attention to. 

For example, if .gitignore contains:
```
build
*.mpl
```

then Git will ignore any file or directory called ```build``` (and, if it's a directory, anything in it), as well as any file whose name ends in ```.mpl```.
